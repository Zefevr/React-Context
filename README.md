# React Context Example
This repo contains a simple aplication using React Context. The objetive of this app is to get in touch with Context, learn how to get data in and out from the store and get and overview of when to use Context or Redux (or both).

The app is a simple input where you can select the language from english to dutch with their flags. Using Context I pass the language and color of the app down to their children. (the input does not submit anything though ;)

### Installation:

Clone this repository. Run `npm install` to install all libraries.

* On Client's folder: Run `npm start` to listen app on local port.
